### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of the easiest labs. This lab was a great intro to computer programming. It is amazing to look back and see how far I've come as a computer programmer. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2, was one of my favorite labs. This lab was fun to code because we were creating a game. One of my favorite parts were when we were manually testing it, because we actually got to play the game we created.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, was one of the more interesting ones. We learned how to code extended loops. We also learned how to work with bool fucntions to determine wheter out outcome would be true or false.
